Different Distance Based Classification techniques on IRIS Data set

ABOUT:

The Iris dataset is a classic dataset for classification, machine learning 
and data visualization.The dataset contains 3 classes (Iris-setosa, Iris-virginica 
and Iris-versicolor) with 50 samples each.Four features were measured from each sample: 
Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, and Petal Width in centimeters.

OBJECTIVE:

Our objective is to classify the testing samples with help of length and 
width of either sepal or petal  i.e using any two features.

INSTALL:

This project requires Python 3.6 and the following Python libraries installed :-

>NumPy
>Pandas
>Sklearn
>Matplotlib
>Jupyter Notebook

If Python is not installed yet, Anaconda distribution of Python can also be used, 
which already has the above packages.

DATA:

The dataset used in this project is included as iris.data in the zip file. 
Iris dataset is freely available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository.
But for this assignment, dataset is imported from sklearn.datasets (load_iris).
Two features from IRIS dataset has been taken as parameters with 0.6 as training data.
10 distance metrics has been used to predict the outcome of the IRIS species.

OUTPUT:

The output shown is-
 
>Predicted class labels 
>Error Plot (Classifier Vs Misclassification error rates)
>Mean error, Mean Squared Error and Mean Absolute error
